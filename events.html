            <h2>Hour of Code</h2>
            <p>
                The Hour of Code is a global movement designed to generate excitement in young people about programming and technology. Games, tutorials, and other events are organized during the Computer Science Education Week every year between December 4th and 10th. This year, the ACM Student Chapter of SVCE decided to contribute their part to this global initiative by conducting a participatory workshop in Don Bosco School on 4th December 2017. About 40 students from 9th and 10th grades attended the event. An interactive tutorial (from the hourofcode.com) which focuses on the basics of Python, was used to ensure a great learning experience for the students.  It had a chatter bot, named Eliza, explain the basic concepts of Python such as input, print and loop statements. The students then tried their hand at coding with some guidance from the ACM volunteers. The students were more than just excited with the tutorial sessions and the hands on experience. They participated passionately and gained reasonable expertise on the fundamental concepts of Python. The workshop thereby succeeded in giving students a head start for their future endeavors. They were actually able to widen their knowledge about coding and thus the essence of Hour of Code was achieved.

                On 28th December 2018 a technical lecture on block chain was conducted by Mr. Tarun Chinmai, a blockchain enthusiast and a software developer at Akamai. The session started off with an introduction on what the blockchain is, some information about its mysterious creator and the reasoning behind its creation. He then touched on the most popular cryptocurrencies with brief explanations on each of them. The lecture included demos of the blockchain ledger system as well as a clear explanation of the hash functions involved and the concept of 'mining'. Tarun also debunked the many myths about blockchain. He then went into an in depth explanation on Merkel trees and their uses in the blockchain. It ended with an interactive Q&A session with questions involving everything from Mt. Gox to whether they should invest in cryptocurrency.

                A non-technical quiz based on technological trends and facts was conducted on 16th February, 2018. It was divided into 4 different rounds. The quiz started off with the Quizmaster, Akash Saravanan explaining the rules and the format. After a trick question to put the crowd at ease, the quiz began with an energized audience. The first round consisted of questions over a variety of fields which have been in the news recently. The questions in this round related to everything from Snapchat’s recent design update and the uproar behind it to cryptocurrency millionaires, Boston Dynamics’ Spot Mini robot and the recent Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities. The second round was a logo round with 15 logos that the teams were asked to identify. This round was followed by a “Connect” round wherein the teams were presented with a series of images and were asked to connect them to a specific language, company, technology or person. The final round was an exciting 20 question round on technology, both new and old.
                <br />
                Overall, there were 18 teams of 2 evenly spread across the 2nd and 3rd years. Ultimately, CoreML consisting of Gurudutt P. and Chran S. of the 3rd year came out as the winner by a narrow margin.
                The event was a very informational and exciting session for all the participants and they requested more quizzes to be conducted. A majority of the participants praised the selection of questions and stated that they acquired new knowledge that they wouldn’t have normally encountered.
